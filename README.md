# Website & Blog

This repository contains everything for my [personal website](https://hcostax.com), including all [blog posts](https://hcostax.com/blog). The site is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [deployed](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/netlify.html) via [Netlify](https://netlify.com) using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/tree/main/publish).

## Acknowledgements

While plenty of work went into making the site my own, I used Silvia Canel√≥n's [website](https://silviacanelon.com/) [repository](https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia) as a starting point, and their excellent blog post about [porting Hugo websites to Quarto](https://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/) as guidance.
